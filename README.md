# SQLPackRat

SQLPackRat is a simple Objective-C wrapper for SQLite.

It's based on some code used in several of my projects. The goal is to iterate this code towards simpler interfaces, and to build test cases to cover everything.

This is a work in progress.

## Requirements

SQLPackRat requires the modern Objective-C runtime. It can be used by 32- or 64-bit iOS targets, but only supports 64-bit targets on OS X.

Little effort will be spent keeping SQLPackRat compatible with older compilers.

## Use

Use instructions to come later. For now, you have the sourcesâ€¦ add them to your project and build.
