# SQLPackRat

SQLPackRat is a simple Objective-C wrapper for SQLite.

It's based on some code used in several of my projects. The goal is to iterate this code towards simpler interfaces, and to build test cases to cover everything.

This is a work in progress.

## Requirements

SQLPackRat requires the modern Objective-C runtime, and therefore runs only 32- or 64-bit iOS targets, but only on 64-bit OS X targets.

Little effort will be spent keeping SQLPackRat compatible with older compilers.
